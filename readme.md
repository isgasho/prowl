# Prowl: PROcedural WorLd generator

Prowl is a general-purpose procedural generation library that provides several
useful utilities to facilitate the generation and continued simulation of a
virtual world.

## Design

Prowl uses a system of generated Actors (Agents?) that have stats and desires.
These stats and desires are random, but influence how the Actor acts during
every simulation step. Actors try and maximize their progress toward their
goals, and with enough actors.
